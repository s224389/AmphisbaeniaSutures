# AmphisbaeniaSutures
Data and scripts for extracting cranial sutures of Amphisbaenia. From project work at DTU course 01666

## Description
This repository is by no means a complete project, as the data can not be published. It serves as documentation of the code used in the DTU course 01666 during the spring of 2024.
Each folder contains the notebook used for extracting the curve for each species. It also contains images of all settings used to obtain the results shown in the project PDF.
